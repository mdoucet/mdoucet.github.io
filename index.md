# Who I am
I'm a research scientist focused developing AI strategies to benefit science and education.

# Recent activities

## August @ Band Gap
- Working with Johns Hopkins University's Center for Technology in Education on guildelines for the adoption of AI in education.
- Last month Band Gap tested the limits of coding agents to support the development of our applications. This month I tested out our lessons learned by guiding a coding agent through the development of a Dart package we needed to extract structured data from unstructured text. Article to come!


## August @ ORNL
- Presented a seminar on neutron scattering to study catalysis at the SUNCAT Summer Institute at SLAC. The summer institute welcomes students and postdocs from across the globe to learn about recent trends in catalysis research.
- Worked with colleagues in the community to write a compeling science case for a catalysis-focused beamline at the Second Target Station (STS) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). The STS would be a 2-billion investment from DOE. Quantum materials and catalysis are two areas where such an investment could make a big difference.
